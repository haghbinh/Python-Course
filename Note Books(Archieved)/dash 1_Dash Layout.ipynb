    "# Introduction to Dash\n",
    "Dash is a productive Python framework for building web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Written on top of Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js, Dash is ideal for building data visualization apps with highly custom user interfaces in pure Python. It's particularly suited for anyone who works with data in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a couple of simple patterns, Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols that are required to build an interactive web-based application. Dash is simple enough that you can bind a user interface around your Python code in an afternoon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dash apps are rendered in the web browser. You can deploy your apps to servers and then share them through URLs. Since Dash apps are viewed in the web browser, Dash is inherently cross-platform and mobile ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dash is an open source library, released under the permissive MIT license. Plotly develops Dash and offers a platform for managing Dash apps in an enterprise environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Dash Installation\n",
    "In your terminal, install several dash libraries. These libraries are under active development, so install and upgrade frequently. Python 2 and 3 are supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install dash==1.13.3\n",
